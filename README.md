It is an Adobe Illustrator template and workflow for creating specialized posters and signs fast.  

Users can use their own data and change their own colors + font family, to create time-aware and expedient materials that address specific issues. 

Users all over the world can use my VariableImporter script (they have to google it), which helps import different languages unlike the Adobe-native import feature
